# Email Security and PowerShell

Within this repo is my presentation and associated content from my talk(s) on PowerShell and Email Security. The basis of the presentation revolves around a ew main points

## SPF

I go very in depth on the origins of SPF, how it came to be and what it's function is

### Sender ID

I briefly highlight Sender ID and show why it's not used anymore

## DKIM

I cover DKIM in a medium depth overview and show how it's used especially in alignment to DMARC.

## DMARC

This is a very in depth overview of DMARC, and how it combines SPF and DKIM along with alignment methods to demonstrate email security.

## Demo

The demo is only show in person, but I demonstrate how O365 is inherently vulnerable to all DMARC phishing attacks due to the nature of how it works. As Microsoft cares more about email deliverability rather than security.
